function [costMatrix, distanceMatrix] = computecostmatrix(locCities)
%
% Function:
% - computeCostMatrix: Calculates the cost matrix of a group of cities
%
% Inputs:
% - locCities: Location x and y of each city (nCitiesx2 double)
% 
% Outputs: 
% â€“ costMatrix: Cost matrix calculated as 1/distanceMatrix (nCitiesxnCities
% double)
% - distanceMatrix: Distance matrix where i, j denotes the distance
% between cities i and j (nCitiesxnCities double)
